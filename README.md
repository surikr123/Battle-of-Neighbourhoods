## Restaurant in Toronto:
A chain of restaurant owners in Ontario, Canada want to expand their business. Currently they have their restaurants open in cities like Ottawa, Brampton and Hamilton. They figured out that they would make more profit by opening up a restaurant in Toronto as Toronto is the largest city of Canada. So they want to open up a new restaurant some place nice with good neighbourhood in Toronto. They are having trouble figuring out which place to chose within Toronto to open their new restaurant. We have to help them figure out which place to chose where there business will be good, they have less competition and nice people live around. They want to know about 2-3 such places so that they can decide for themselves which one is the best.
